I've renewed my blog with Typescript, Next.js and MDX to start blogging again. So in this article, I want to share how I renewed my blog.

# Why am I trying to do it again?

I want to try fancy new stacks, Next.js and MDX more. The previous blog was built with jekyll. It was kind of OK, but I was not happy about it. I guess the biggest reason was that I don't know Ruby language.(And I don't want to learn it either...Haha) Also, as a member of unifiedjs colletive, I want to try MDX which is based on Remark. It is really promising. I was a bit skeptical before I tried. But now, I'll definitely recommend it to others.

Another reason is that I want to share my ideas. Since the beginning of last August, my company's let me fully focus on the renewal of our Boostnote project, AKA Boostnote.next. I've been really wanting to do it. So I'm VERY MOTIVATED NOW! And, while working on the Boostnote.next project, I've been inventing lots of interesting tools like prismy. They are really cool. My colleagues also like them a lot because they are fixing most problems of the current conventional solutions. But, sadly, I realized that I don't have enough channels to share these ideas... So I fixed up the stage to start my show again.

The last reason is that I want to improve my English ability. For the past year, my English has improved quite a lot. Although I'm living in Japan and Korea, I'm using English most of the time because my girlfriend is from the US and my coworkers are from the UK and France. So now, I can speak and write English without hesitation. But my English is still broken. To fix it, I think blogging in English should be one of the best ways.

But, although I'm quite motivated, the renewal was not easy. I thought I could finish it in a week but it took almost a month. To be honest, the biggest reason for the delay was that I played Apex Legends too much. I'd been undergoing lots of trial and error too. In this section, I want to share the cause of my suffering.

## Difference between Markdown and MDX

MDX introduced itself as a superset of markdown with JSX supporting. So you can mix markdown and JSX(rendered from React Component) in your markdown articles. Also, via `MDXProvider`, you could set the layout components from outside the MDX file. It is really cool. But supporting JSX might causes some problems. One of the articles in my old blog was using `<img>` tags. As you know, in HTML5, you are supposed to write the `<img>` tag without closing. But, JSX syntax always forces us to close tags. Therefore, MDX forces us to close all tags too. Moreover, the error message looks really confusing. As you see in the below error message, it doesn't say which JSX contents are not closed. At first, I thought the configurations for Babel or Webpack were wrong. But the problem was that I forgot to close an `<img>` tag in the middle of the article. So, if you're going to migrate old markdown content into MDX, please make sure that all tags are closed.

```
[ error ] ./pages/posts/monorepo-and-lerna.md
SyntaxError: unknown: Unterminated JSX contents (102:16)

  100 | <pre><code parentName="pre" {...{"className":"language-json"}}>{`  "npmClient": "yarn"
  101 | `}</code></pre>
> 102 |     </MDXLayout>
      |                 ^
  103 |   )
  104 | };
  105 | MDXContent.isMDXComponent = true
```

## Do NOT use API routes for static HTML exporting

From Next.js v9, Zeit introduced the API routes feature. It is really cool too because it lets me make serverless apps with no extra configuration. But it didn't work for static exporting. To know the reason, we need to understand how the `next export` script works. `next export` pre-renders every page into HTML from the output of the `next build` script to mimic SSR. But, while rendering, Next.js won't serve API routes, so page components will fail to fetch data from API routes. But if you're using external APIs, it should be fine as long as you can access the internet.

## Avoid rendering markdown contents from the frontend side

The first attempt to render markdown in this renewal was hosting the markdown contents in the `static` directory, fetching them via `getInitialProps` and render into `ReactNode` via remark and its plugins.

> - Post files in `static` : https://github.com/Rokt33r/blog/tree/f023ecbb4b72555480d36de5c26c06a27dfad481/static/posts

Then, while building the app, I noticed that the size of some pages using this strategy skyrocket...

```
Page                            Size     Files  Packages
â”Œ Ïƒ /                           34.3 kB     25        17
â”œ   /_app                       4.41 kB      0        16
â”œ   /_document
â”œ   /_error                     3.34 kB      0        17
â”œ âš¡ /about                      5.01 kB     13        16
â”œ Ïƒ /categories/[categoryName]  34.5 kB     25        17
â”œ Ïƒ /posts                      34.2 kB     25        17
â”” Ïƒ /posts/[postName]           1.22 MB     25        82
                                  â†‘â†‘â†‘
                           Mega Bytes? Seriously??
```

What happened here?

So as you see, the file is using **82 packages** although I used just two remark plugins for parsing frontmatter and syntax highlighting.

Actually, remark and rehype theirselves are quite small, like hundreds of kilobytes. (It is still big though compared to other pages.) So I'm guessing `rehype-highlight`, which highlights the syntax of code fences, caused the problem mostly. But most people would want to set syntax highlighting for their articles... And it could be worse because I'm also thinking to introduce remark-math one day, which includes Math equation blocks and rendering them via KaTeX.

So I decide to use MDX to compile markdown in advance. Then I got better results.

```

â”Œ âš¡ /                                     111 kB      13        17
â”œ   /_app                                 87.5 kB      0        16

```

In conclusion, I recommend using MDX to render your page blazingly fast. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

# What's next?

Although my blog looks much better now, I'm still thinking lots of things can be improved even more.

One thing is component design. I was trying to adopt atomic design, but I'm still not good at it. Also, the DX of using styled-components and typescript together was quite terrible when I tried to override the style of some components. So I'll try to figure out a best practice.

Another issue is introducing the Continuous Delivery tool. Recently, I was granted access to Github Actions. It looks really cool, so I'll try to adopt it this month.

And there should be more too. I want to put some external content, like Youtube video, in my notes easily. I should also introduce a comment form somehow so I can get feedback from other people.

To sum up, I'm really excited now that I can write more articles with this new platform. Also the above issues should be good topics to write for the next articles! Then, I'll be back soon. Thanks for reading!
